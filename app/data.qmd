# Approaches

Data are a crucial piece of this research project. As such, much of the effort and consideration went into selecting, crafting, and refactoring the datasets to suit the need as best as possible. Throughout this process, many things were tried and tossed away. These include the form of the data, and even methods for processing the data to make it easier for certain machine learning models to use them. In the end, an effective appraoch was discovered. Each of these snapshots will be covered below.

## The Old Data

Both the [wind](https://data.nrel.gov/submissions/54) and [solar](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/) data used in this project orginally come from The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The data comes with many attributes that are crucial to the analysis this project seeks to conduct, however, there are still pieces missing to truly acheive the full picture. Regardless, compared to other publically available datasets, these were the best suited for the job, and offered a good starting point.

### Structure and Make-up

The original datasets came with some basic attributes:

- longitude
- latitude
- wind speed
- solar irradiance
- capacity
- capacity factor

This, at first, is not enough data to begin predicting for energy generation and cost. For this, actual data on energy generation and cost is needed. With what was provided, these could be calculated. To start, a few simple calculations were used to find the energy and cost values desired. The attribute `capacity` denotes how much energy a certain technology can produce under ideal conditions. `Capacity factor` denotes what fraction of the technology's `capacity` is produced. With this, a simple estimate for energy generation can be calculated by multiplying both values together. For cost, many estimates exist that outline how much a technology costs per watt of installed capacity. Using these estimates, and multiplying by capacity, a value for cost can be aquired. This produced two datasets that took this shape:

#### Old Wind Data

#### Old Solar Data

The rough and simplistic nature of these estimates are generally okay as the concern of this project is to determine how well machine learning algorithms predict values, and not the correctness and integrity of the values themselves. Nonetheless, issues still appeared because of this. When training and testing the Random Forest Regressor, a feature importance graph was used to determine which attributes are the most important. This can also give insights into how the variables are used by other models as well. When running on the old wind data, the graph indicated one variable was dominating the dataset.
